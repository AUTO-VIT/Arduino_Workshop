# Arduino Workshop



## Difference between Microprocessors and Microcontrollers
Microprocessor
Large scale     small scale

arduino hads ram and proceesor in a asingle chip

Why arduino
open source software
easy to learn
huge community
cheap
simulators to work on project in times of lack of board

## Basic Components
capacitors
resistors
bread board

Anatomy of an Arduino board
- types of arduino boards
- pins
  (digital pins)
  (analoag pins)
- microcontroller

Types of input and output

pwm- pulse with modilstion
only 0 1 output

types of communication
serial uart - forward and reverse (master slave)
tx
rx
bps

I2C
SPI

UART VS I2C VS SPI

BASIC SENSORS AND ACTUATOR DRIVERS
actuators - motors

Arduino ide

arduino coding

void setup(){
}
void loop () {
}
pin mode(2,output)
digitalWrite(2,LOW)
digital Read (3)
analogWrite(A2,156)
analogRead(A2)
delay(5000)
Serial.begin(9600)
Serial.println(digitalRead(2))
